\section{Results}
Overall, there are 30 systems with eclipse-modelled characterisations available for use.
However, not all are suitable; as detailed in \S\ref{sect:modelling:MESA massloss allowable mass range}, the donor mass range for which modelling is possible is $0.08 M_\odot < M_{\rm donor} < 0.20 M_\odot$.
Applying this cut to the data leaves 20\todo{21 if SDSSJ1524 is usable - it probably is by the lightcurves?} systems.
The properties of these donors, and their inferred $\dot M$, is given in Table~\ref{table:results:mdot modelling}. Note that no errors are given, as the inferred values of $\dot M$ are dominated by systematic uncertainty, rather than the statistical error arising from the uncertainty of the mass and radius.

\subsection{Negative inflations}

Note that not all systems in Table~\ref{table:results:mdot modelling} are assigned a $\dot M$. This is due some donors being smaller than the Brown relation, adjusted for non-spherical geometry, resulting in negative inflation that cannot be achieved by the introduction of mass loss.
This is likely a consequence of the significant scatter in the M dwarf $M - R$ relationship, which is unavoidable with this technique.

\section{Mass loss from white dwarf effective temperatures}

The characterised CVs also have the white dwarf temperature loosely constrained, allowing the short-term mass loss rate to also be inferred as suggested in \S\ref{}
