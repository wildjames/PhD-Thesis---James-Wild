I declare that, unless otherwise stated, the work presented in this thesis is my own.
No part of this thesis has been accepted or is currently being submitted for any other qualification at the University of Sheffield or elsewhere.

Some of this work is adapted from a prior publication -- Chapter~\ref{chpt:three peculiar white dwarfs} is published as \cite{wild2021} in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society under the title \textit{System parameters of three short period cataclysmic variable stars} by Wild, Littlefair, Ashley, Breedt, Brown, Dhillon, Dyer, Green, Kerry, Marsh, Parsons, and Sahman.
