@article{Green2020,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Ultracompact accreting binary systems each consist of a stellar remnant accreting helium-enriched material from a compact donor star. Such binaries include two related sub-classes, AM CVn-type binaries and helium cataclysmic variables, in both of which the central star is a white dwarf. We present a spectroscopic and photometric study of six accreting binaries with orbital periods in the range of 40–70 min, including phase-resolved VLT spectroscopy and high-speed ULTRACAM photometry. Four of these are AM CVn systems and two are helium cataclysmic variables. For four of these binaries we are able to identify orbital periods (of which three are spectroscopic). SDSS J1505+0659 has an orbital period of 67.8 min, significantly longer than previously believed, and longer than any other known AM CVn binary. We identify a Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) infrared excess in SDSS J1505+0659 that we believe to be the first direct detection of an AM CVn donor star in a non-direct impacting binary. The mass ratio of SDSS J1505+0659 is consistent with a white dwarf donor. CRTS J1028–0819 has an orbital period of 52.1 min, the shortest period of any helium cataclysmic variable. MOA 2010-BLG-087 is co-aligned with a K-class star that dominates its spectrum. ASASSN-14ei and ASASSN-14mv both show a remarkable number of echo outbursts following superoutbursts (13 and 10 echo outbursts respectively). ASASSN-14ei shows an increased outburst rate over the years following its superoutburst, perhaps resulting from an increased accretion rate.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{britt2015,
abstract = {We measure the duty cycles for an existing sample of well-observed, nearby dwarf novae (DNe) using data from American Association of Variable Star Observers, and present a quantitative empirical relation between the duty cycle of DNe outbursts and the X-ray luminosity of the system in quiescence. We have found that logDC = 0.63(±0.21) x (log L{\textless}inf{\textgreater}X{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}(erg s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) - 31.3) - 0.95(±0.1), where DC stands for duty cycle. We note that there is intrinsic scatter in this relation greater than what is expected from purely statistical errors. Using the DN X-ray luminosity functions from Pretorius {\&} Knigge and Byckling et al., we compare this relation to the number of DNe in the Galactic Bulge Survey which were identified through optical outbursts during an 8-d-long monitoring campaign. We find a specific frequency of Xray- bright (LX ≥ 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}31{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} erg s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) cataclysmic variables (CVs) undergoing DNe outbursts in the direction of the Galactic bulge of 6.6 ± 4.7 x 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-5{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}M{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\{}bull's eye{\}}. Such a specific frequency would give a solar neighbourhood space density of long-period CVs of $\rho$ = 5.6 ± 3.9 x 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-6{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} pc{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. We advocate the use of specific frequency in future work, given that projects like Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will detect DNe well outside the distance range over which $\rho$ ≈ const.},

@article{belloni2018,
abstract = {The predicted and observed space density of cataclysmic variables (CVs) has been for a long time discrepant by at least an order of magnitude. The standard model of CV evolution predicts that the vast majority of CVs should be period bouncers, whose space density has been recently measured to be $\rho$ ≲ 2 × 10-5 pc-3.We performed population synthesis of CVs using an updated version of the Binary Stellar Evolution (BSE) code for single and binary star evolution. We find that the recently suggested empirical prescription of consequential angular momentum loss (CAML) brings into agreement predicted and observed space densities of CVs and period bouncers. To progress with our understanding of CV evolution it is crucial to understand the physical mechanism behind empirical CAML. Our changes to the BSE code are also provided in details, which will allow the community to accurately model mass transfer in interacting binaries in which degenerate objects accrete from low-mass main-sequence donor stars.},

@article{hallinan2013,
abstract = {Hot Jupiters have been proposed as a likely population of low-frequency radio sources due to electron cyclotron maser emission of similar nature to that detected from the auroral regions of magnetized solar system planets. Such emission will likely be confined to specific ranges of orbital/rotational phase due to a narrowly beamed radiation pattern. We report on GMRT 150 MHz radio observations of the hot Jupiter $\tau$ Bo{\"{o}}tis b, consisting of 40 hr carefully scheduled to maximize coverage of the planet's 79.5 hr orbital/rotational period in an effort to detect such rotationally modulated emission. The resulting image is the deepest yet published at these frequencies and leads to a 3$\sigma$ upper limit on the flux density from the planet of 1.2 mJy, two orders of magnitude lower than predictions derived from scaling laws based on solar system planetary radio emission. This represents the most stringent upper limits for both quiescent and rotationally modulated radio emission from a hot Jupiter yet achieved and suggests that either (1) the magnetic dipole moment of $\tau$ Bo{\"{o}}tis b is insufficient to generate the surface field strengths of {\textgreater}50 G required for detection at 150 MHz or (2) Earth lies outside the beaming pattern of the radio emission from the planet. {\textcopyright} 2013.

@article{Hennebelle2013,
abstract = {Magnetic field are ubiquitous to young and mature low-mass stars, and can potentially impact their formation, their evolution and their internal structure; yet the physical processes that succeed at amplifying and sustaining these fields (called dynamo processes), like those capable of changing the fate of the host stars (and in particular their rotation rates), are still somewhat enigmatic. Although theoretical modelling and numerical simulations (e.g., of stellar dynamo action and magnetospheric accretion processes) showed breathtaking progress in the last decade, they are not yet in the state of accurately predicting the various magnetic topologies that different low-mass stars can generate nor the impact such fields can have on stellar formation. Thanks to the advent of new-generation instruments, spectropolari-metric observations coupled to tomographic techniques can now reveal the large-scale magnetic topologies of both young and mature low-mass stars, and in particular their poloidal and toroidal components. More specifically, one can now investigate magnetic topologies of cool dwarfs, all the way from the brown dwarf threshold (spectral type M8) where stars are fully convective up to the limit beyond which outer convec-tive zones get vanishingly small (spectral type F5); one can also explore the magnetic topologies of young low-mass stars that are still accret-ing mass from their circumstellar disc (i.e., the classical T Tauri stars) and study how such fields can impact mass accretion processes from the surrounding discs. We review herein the latest observational advances in this field, showing in particular that large-scale magnetic topologies of low-mass stars and protostars can drastically vary with mass and rotation rate, and discuss their implications for our understanding of dynamo processes, stellar formation and stellar evolution.},

abstract = {We report the first direct detection of a strong, 5 kG magnetic field on the surface of an active brown dwarf. LSR J1835+3259 is an M8.5 dwarf exhibiting transient radio and optical emission bursts modulated by fast rotation. We have detected the surface magnetic field as circularly polarized signatures in the 819 nm sodium lines when an active emission region faced the Earth. Modeling Stokes profiles of these lines reveals the effective temperature of 2800 K and log gravity acceleration of 4.5. These parameters place LSR J1835+3259 on evolutionary tracks as a young brown dwarf with the mass of 55{\$}\backslashpm{\$}4 M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm J{\}}{\$} and age of 22{\$}\backslashpm{\$}4 Myr. Its magnetic field is at least 5.1 kG and covers at least 11{\%} of the visible hemisphere. The active region topology recovered using line profile inversions comprises hot plasma loops with a vertical stratification of optical and radio emission sources. These loops rotate with the dwarf in and out of view causing periodic emission bursts. The magnetic field is detected at the base of the loops. This is the first time that we can quantitatively associate brown dwarf non-thermal bursts with a strong, 5 kG surface magnetic field and solve the puzzle of their driving mechanism. This is also the coolest known dwarf with such a strong surface magnetic field. The young age of LSR J1835+3259 implies that it may still maintain a disk, which may facilitate bursts via magnetospheric accretion, like in higher-mass T Tau-type stars. Our results pave a path toward magnetic studies of brown dwarfs and hot Jupiters.},

@article{morin2010,
abstract = {We present here the final results of the first spectropolarimetric survey of a small sample of active M dwarfs, aimed at providing observational constraints on dynamo action on both sides of the full-convection threshold (spectral type M4). Our two previous studies were focused on early and mid M dwarfs. The present paper examines 11 fully convective late M dwarfs (spectral types M5–M8). Tomographic imaging techniques were applied to time-series of circularly polarized profiles of six stars, in order to infer their large-scale magnetic topologies. For three other stars we could not produce such magnetic maps, because of low variability of the Stokes V signatures, but were able to derive some properties of the magnetic fields.We find two distinct categories of magnetic topologies: on the one hand strong axisymmetric dipolar fields (similar to mid M dwarfs), and on the other hand weak fields generally featuring a significant non-axisymmetric component, and sometimes a significant toroidal one. Comparison with unsigned magnetic fluxes demonstrates that the second category of magnetic fields shows less organization (less energy in the large scales), similarly to partly convective early M dwarfs. Stars in both categories have similar stellar parameters, our data do not evidence a separation between these two categories in the mass–rotation plane.We also report marginal detection of a large-scale magnetic field on the M8 star VB 10 featuring a significant toroidal axisymmetric component, whereas no field is detectable on VB 8 (M7).},

However, the photometric method relies on a number of assumptions, and to date there have been very few independent checks of this method in the literature. We present time-resolved spectroscopy of the P= 90.9 min eclipsing CV OY Carinae obtained with X-shooter on the Very Large Telescope (VLT), in which we detect the donor star from Ki lines in the J band. We measure the radial velocity amplitude of the donor star K 2= 470.0 ± 2.7 kms -1, consistent with predictions based upon the photometric method (470 ± 7 kms -1). Additionally, the spectra obtained in the UVB arm of X-shooter show a series of Fei and Feii lines with a phase and velocity consistent with an origin in the accretion disc. This is the first unambiguous detection at optical wavelengths of the 'iron curtain' of disc material which has been previously reported to veil the white dwarf in this system. The velocities of these lines do not track the white dwarf, reflecting a distortion of the outer disc that we see also in Doppler images. This is evidence for considerable radial motion in the outer disc, at up to 90 kms -1 towards and away from the white dwarf. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2012 RAS.},

The new library consists of 131 calibrated spectra, encompassing all normal spectral types and luminosity classes at solar abundance, and metal-weak and metal-rich FFK dwarf and GGK giant components. Each library spectrum was formed by combining data from several sources overlapping in wavelength coverage. The SIM-BAD database, measured colors and line strengths were used to check that each input component has closely similar stellar type. The library has complete spectral coverage from 1150|10620 A for all components, and to 25000 A for about half of them, mainly later types of solar abundance. Missing spectral coverage in the infrared currently con-sists of a smooth energy distribution formed from standard colors for the relevant t ypes. The library is designed to permit inclusion of additional digital spectra, particularly of non-solar abundance stars in the infrared, as they become available. The library spectra are each given as F vs. , from 1150|25000 A in steps of 5 A. A program to combine the library spectra in the ratios appropriate to a selected isochrone is described, and an example spectral component signature of a composite population of solar age and metallicity illustrated.

abstract = {We report on the results from the first six months of the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS). In order to search for optical transients with timescales of minutes to years, the CRTS analyses data from the Catalina Sky Survey which repeatedly covers twenty six thousand of square degrees on the sky. The CRTS provides a public stream of transients that are bright enough to be followed up using small telescopes. Since the beginning of the survey, all CRTS transients have been made available to astronomers around the world in real-time using HTML tables, RSS feeds and VOEvents. As part of our public outreach program the detections are now also available in KML through Google Sky. The initial discoveries include over 350 unique optical transients rising more than two magnitudes from past measurements. Sixty two of these are classified as supernovae, based on light curves, prior deep imaging and spectroscopic data. Seventy seven are due to cataclysmic variables (only 13 previously known), while an additional 100 transients were too infrequently sampled to distinguish between faint CVs and SNe. The remaining optical transients include AGN, Blazars, high proper motions stars, highly variable stars (such as UV Ceti stars) and transients of an unknown nature. Our results suggest that there is a large population of SNe missed by many current supernova surveys because of selection biases. These objects appear to be associated with faint host galaxies. We also discuss the unexpected discovery of white dwarf binary systems through dramatic eclipses.},

abstract = {A number of problems in probability and statistics can be addressed using the multivariate normal (Gaussian) distribution. In the one-dimensional case, computing the probability for a given mean and variance simply requires the evaluation of the corresponding Gaussian density. In the {\$}n{\$}-dimensional setting, however, it requires the inversion of an {\$}n \backslashtimes n{\$} covariance matrix, {\$}C{\$}, as well as the evaluation of its determinant, {\$}\backslashdet(C){\$}. In many cases, such as regression using Gaussian processes, the covariance matrix is of the form {\$}C = \backslashsigma{\^{}}2 I + K{\$}, where {\$}K{\$} is computed using a specified covariance kernel which depends on the data and additional parameters (hyperparameters). The matrix {\$}C{\$} is typically dense, causing standard direct methods for inversion and determinant evaluation to require {\$}\backslashmathcal O(n{\^{}}3){\$} work. This cost is prohibitive for large-scale modeling. Here, we show that for the most commonly used covariance functions, the matrix {\$}C{\$} can be hierarchically factored into a product of block low-rank updates of the identity matrix, yielding an {\$}\backslashmathcal O (n\backslashlog{\^{}}2 n) {\$} algorithm for inversion. More importantly, we show that this factorization enables the evaluation of the determinant {\$}\backslashdet(C){\$}, permitting the direct calculation of probabilities in high dimensions under fairly broad assumptions on the kernel defining {\$}K{\$}. Our fast algorithm brings many problems in marginalization and the adaptation of hyperparameters within practical reach using a single CPU core. The combination of nearly optimal scaling in terms of problem size with high-performance computing resources will permit the modeling of previously intractable problems. We illustrate the performance of the scheme on standard covariance kernels.},

Chemical abundances in the stars' atmospheres were measured from previous optical spectra and from the new ultraviolet observations. Iron-group metals, including cobalt, copper and zinc, are highly enriched relative to typical subdwarf B (sdB) stars. Lead is also enriched, but with an abundance similar to other sdB stars.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). Edelmann identified two chemically peculiar hot subdwarfs, PG0909+276 and UVO0512-08, as having very high overabundances of iron-group elements. We obtained high-resolution ultraviolet spectroscopy in order to measure abundances of species not observable in the optical, and to seek evidence for chemical stratification in the photosphere. Abundances were measured in three wavelength regions; the optical 3900-6900 {\AA} range was re-analysed to confirm consistency with that analysed by Edelmann. Ultraviolet spectra were obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope, covering the far-UV (1140-1740 {\AA}) and the near-UV (1740-2500 {\AA}). We computed a grid of theoretical local thermodynamic equilibrium spectra to find basic parameters (effective temperatures, surface gravity, surface hydrogen and helium fractions). We measured abundances using a spectral-synthesis approach in each wavelength range. We confirm that several irongroup metals are highly enriched, including cobalt, copper and zinc, relative to typical sdB stars. We detect gallium, germanium, tin and lead, similar to analysis of ultraviolet spectra of some other sdB stars. Our results confirm that PG 0909+276 and UVO0512-08 exhibit peculiaritieswhich make them distinct from both the normalH-rich sdB and intermediateHe-rich sdB stars. The process which leads to this particular composition has still to be identified.},

abstract = {We present photometry of nine cataclysmic variable stars identified by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, aimed at measuring the orbital periods of these systems. Four of these objects show deep eclipses, from which we measure their orbital periods. The light curves of three of the eclipsing systems are also analysed using the lcurve code, and their mass ratios and orbital inclinations determined. SDSS J075059.97+ 141150.1 has an orbital period of 134.1564 ± 0. 0008 min, making it a useful object with which to investigate the evolutionary processes of cataclysmic variables. SDSS J092444.48+ 080150.9 has a period of 131. 2432 ± 0. 0014 min and is probably magnetic. The white dwarf ingress and egress phases are very deep and short, and there is no clear evidence that this object has an accretion disc. SDSS J115207.00+404947.8 and SDSS J152419.33+ 220920.1 are nearly identical twins, with periods of 97.5 ± 0.4 and 93. 6 ± 0.5 min and mass ratios of 0. 14 ± 0. 03 and 0.17 ± 0.03, respectively. Their eclipses have well-defined white dwarf and bright spot ingress and egress features, making them excellent candidates for detailed study.

abstract = {We carefully consider observational and theoretical constraints on the global properties of secondary stars in cataclysmic variable stars (CVs). We then use these constraints to construct and test a complete, semi-empirical donor sequence for CVs with orbital periods Porb≤ 6 h. All key physical and photometric parameters of CV secondaries (along with their spectral types) are given as a function of Porb along this sequence. This provides a benchmark for observational and theoretical studies of CV donors and evolution.The main observational basis for our donor sequence is an empirical mass–radius relationship for CV secondaries. Patterson and co-workers have recently shown that this can be derived from superhumping and/or eclipsing CVs. We independently revisit all of the key steps in this derivation, including the calibration of the period excess–mass ratio relation for superhumpers and the use of a single representative primary mass for most CVs. We also present an optimal technique for estimating the parameters of the mass–radius relation that simultaneously ensures consistency with the observed locations of the period gap and the period minimum. We present new determinations of these periods, finding Pgap,+= 3.18 ± 0.04 h (upper edge), Pgap,−= 2.15 ± 0.03 h (lower edge) and Pmin= 76.2 ± 1.0 min (period minimum).We test the donor sequence by comparing observed and predicted spectral types (SpTs) as a function of orbital period. To this end, we update the SpT compilation of Beuermann and co-workers and show explicitly that CV donors have later SpTs than main-sequence (MS) stars at all orbital periods. This extends the conclusion of the earlier study to the short-period regime (Porb {\textless} 3 h). We then compare our donor sequence to the CV data, and find that it does an excellent job of matching the observed SpTs. Thus the empirical mass–radius relation yields just the right amount of radius expansion to account for the later-than-MS spectral types of CV donors. There is remarkably little intrinsic scatter in both the mass–radius and SpT–Porb relations, which confirms that most CVs follow a unique evolution track.The donor sequence exhibits a fairly sharp drop in temperature, luminosity and optical/infrared flux well before the minimum period. This may help to explain why the detection of brown dwarf secondaries in CVs has proven to be extremely difficult.We finally apply the donor sequence to the problem of distance estimation. Based on a sample of 22 CVs with trigonometric parallaxes and reliable 2MASS data, we show that the donor sequence correctly traces the upper envelope of the observed MJHK–Porb distribution. Thus robust lower limits on distances can be obtained from single-epoch infrared observations. However, for our sample, these limits are typically about a factor of 2 below the true distances.},

@article{Kato2009a,
abstract = {We systematically surveyed period variations of superhumps in SU UMa-type dwarf novae based on newly obtained data and past publications. In many systems, the evolution of superhump period are found to be composed of three distinct stages: early evolutionary stage with a longer superhump period, middle stage with systematically varying periods, final stage with a shorter, stable superhump period. During the middle stage, many systems with superhump periods less than 0.08 d show positive period derivatives. Contrary to the earlier claim, we found no clear evidence for variation of period derivatives between superoutburst of the same object. We present an interpretation that the lengthening of the superhump period is a result of outward propagation of the eccentricity wave and is limited by the radius near the tidal truncation. We interpret that late stage superhumps are rejuvenized excitation of 3:1 resonance when the superhumps in the outer disk is effectively quenched. Many of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae showed long-enduring superhumps during the post-superoutburst stage having periods longer than those during the main superoutburst. The period derivatives in WZ Sge-type dwarf novae are found to be strongly correlated with the fractional superhump excess, or consequently, mass ratio. WZ Sge-type dwarf novae with a long-lasting rebrightening or with multiple rebrightenings tend to have smaller period derivatives and are excellent candidate for the systems around or after the period minimum of evolution of cataclysmic variables (abridged).},

@article{Schreiber2016,
abstract = {The average white dwarf (WD) masses in cataclysmic variables (CVs) have been measured to significantly exceed those of single WDs, which is the opposite of what is theoretically expected. We present the results of binary population synthesis models taking into account consequential angular momentum loss (CAML) that is assumed to increase with decreasing WD mass. This approach can not only solve the WD mass problem, but also brings in agreement theoretical predictions and observations of the orbital period distribution and the space density of CVs. We speculate that frictional angular momentum loss following nova eruptions might cause such CAML and could thus be the missing ingredient of CV evolution.},

@article{Feline2004,
abstract = {We present high-speed, three-colour photometry of the faint eclipsing cataclysmic variables XZ Eri and DV UMa. We determine the system parameters through two techniques: first, timings of the eclipse contact phases of the white dwarf and bright-spot using the derivative of the light curve; and secondly, a parameterized model of the eclipse fitted to the observed light curve by chi-squared minimisation. For both objects, we prefer the latter method, as it is less affected by photon noise and rapid flickering. For XZ Eri we obtain a mass ratio q = 0.1098 +/- 0.0017 and an orbital inclination i = 80.16 +/- 0.09 degrees. For DV UMa we derive figures of q = 0.1506 +/- 0.0009 and i = 84.24 +/- 0.07 degrees. The secondary star in XZ Eri has a very low mass Mr/Msun = 0.0842 +/- 0.0024, placing it close to the upper limit on the mass of a brown dwarf.},

abstract = {We present a binary evolution study of cataclysmic variables (CVs) and related systems with white dwarf (WD) accretors, including for example, AM CVn systems, classical novae, supersoft X-ray sources (SXSs), and systems with giant donor stars. Our approach intentionally avoids the complications associated with population synthesis algorithms, thereby allowing us to present the first truly comprehensive exploration of all of the subsequent binary evolution pathways that zero-age CVs might follow (assuming fully non-conservative, Roche-lobe overflow onto an accreting WD) using the sophisticated binary stellar evolution code MESA. The grid consists of 56,000 initial models, including 14 WD accretor masses, 43 donor-star masses (0.1–4.7 M
⊙), and 100 orbital periods. We explore evolution tracks in the orbital period and donor-mass (P
orb–M
don) plane in terms of evolution dwell times, masses of the WD accretor, accretion rate, and chemical composition of the center and surface of the donor star. We report on the differences among the standard CV tracks, those with giant donor stars, and ultrashort period systems. We show where in parameter space one can expect to find SXSs, present a diagnostic to distinguish among different evolutionary paths to forming AM CVn binaries, quantify how the minimum orbital period in CVs depends on the chemical composition of the donor star, and update the P
orb(M
wd) relation for binaries containing WDs whose progenitors lost their envelopes via stable Roche-lobe overflow. Finally, we indicate where in the P
orb–M
don the accretion disks will tend to be stable against the thermal-viscous instability, and where gravitational radiation signatures may be found with LISA.},

The minimum period remains in conflict with theory, suggesting that the angular momentum loss mechanisms are stronger than predicted.},

    abstract = "{A rotation rate and X-ray luminosity analysis is presented for rapidly rotating single and binary M-dwarf systems. X-ray luminosities for the majority of both single and binary M-dwarf systems with periods below ≃5–6 d (equatorial velocities, Veq≳6 km s−1) are consistent with the current rotation-activity paradigm, and appear to saturate at about 10−3 of the stellar bolometric luminosity.The single M-dwarf data show tentative evidence for the super-saturation phenomenon observed in some ultra-fast rotating (≳100 km s−1) G- and K-dwarfs in the IC 2391, IC 2602 and Alpha Persei clusters. The IC 2391 M star VXR60b is the least X-ray active and most rapidly rotating of the short period (Prot≲2 d) stars considered herein, with a period of 0.212 d and an X-ray activity level of about 1.5 sigma below the mean X-ray emission level for most of the single M-dwarf sample. For this star, and possibly one other, we cautiously believe that we have identified the first evidence of super-saturation in M-dwarfs. If we are wrong, we demonstrate that only M-dwarfs rotating close to their break-up velocities are likely to exhibit the super-saturation effect at X-ray wavelengths.The M-dwarf X-ray data also show that there is no evidence for any difference in the X-ray behaviour between the single and binary systems, because for the single stars, the mean log LxLbol=−3.21±0.04 (0.2≲Prot≲10.1 d), whereas for the binary stars, the mean log LxLbol=−3.19±0.10 (0.8≲Prot≲10.4 d).Furthermore, we show that extremely X-ray active M-dwarfs exhibit a blue excess of about 0.1 magnitudes in U-B compared with less active field M-dwarfs. Such an excess level is comparable to that observed for extremely chromospherically active M-dwarfs. Moreover, as is the case for M-dwarf Ca ii H and K activity levels, there is an exclusion zone of X-ray activity between the extremely active M-dwarfs and the less active ones.}",

	abstract = {We present a sample of 824 solar and late-type stars with X-ray luminosities and rotation periods. This is used to study the relationship between rotation and stellar activity and derive a new estimate of the convective turnover time. From an unbiased subset of this sample the power-law slope of the unsaturated regime, LX/Lbol∝Roβ, is fit as β = −2.70 ± 0.13. This is inconsistent with the canonical β = −2 slope to a confidence of 5σ, and argues for an additional term in the dynamo number equation. From a simple scaling analysis this implies ΔΩ/Ω∝Ω0.7, i.e., the differential rotation of solar-type stars gradually declines as they spin down. Supersaturation is observed for the fastest rotators in our sample and its parametric dependencies are explored. Significant correlations are found with both the corotation radius and the excess polar updraft, the latter theory providing a stronger dependence and being supported by other observations. We estimate mass-dependent empirical thresholds for saturation and supersaturation and map out three regimes of coronal emission. Late F-type stars are shown never to pass through the saturated regime, passing straight from supersaturated to unsaturated X-ray emission. The theoretical threshold for coronal stripping is shown to be significantly different from the empirical saturation threshold (Ro < 0.13), suggesting it is not responsible. Instead we suggest that a different dynamo configuration is at work in stars with saturated coronal emission. This is supported by a correlation between the empirical saturation threshold and the time when stars transition between convective and interface sequences in rotational spin-down models.}

abstract = {We present measurements of the component masses in 15 Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) - 6 new estimates and 9 improved estimates. We provide new calibrations of the relationship between superhump period excess and mass ratio, and use this relation to estimate donor star masses for 225 superhumping CVs. With an increased sample of donor masses we revisit the implications for CV evolution. We confirm the high mass of white dwarfs in CVs, but find no trend in white dwarf mass with orbital period. We argue for a revision in the location of the orbital period minimum of CVs to {\$}79.6 \backslashpm 0.2{\$} min, significantly shorter than previous estimates. We find that CV donors below the gap have an intrinsic scatter of only 0.005 R{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} around a common evolutionary track, implying a correspondingly small variation in angular momentum loss rates. In contrast to prior studies, we find that standard CV evolutionary tracks - without additional angular momentum loss - are a reasonable fit to the donor masses just below the period gap, but that they do not reproduce the observed period minimum, or fit the donor radii below 0.1 M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}.},

@article{Whitehurst1988,
abstract = {Numerical simulations of the SU UMa star Z Cha in outburst are presented which demonstrate the role of the secondary's tidal influence upon the accretion flow and provide explanations for the superhumps seen in SU UMa stars. The results show that for a system with an extreme mass-ratio q = 0.15, the disk is tidally unstable and can become asymmetric and slowly rotate in the inertial frame of reference. The tidal stresses raised in this disk by the secondary produce a peak in the light curve which is interpreted as the superhump. Such behavior will occur only for systems with mass-ratios more extreme than approximately 4:1, which is consistent with the known mass-ratio of SU UMa stars and other cataclysmic variables. It is suggested that outbursts are periods of high disk viscosity, while in quiescence the disk is in a low-viscosity state.},

It is shown that the time scale of collapse is of the same order of magnitude as the time scale of the nuclear evolution for W UMa type binaries.

@article{Savoury2011,
abstract = {We present high-speed, three-colour photometry of the eclipsing cataclysmic variables CTCV 1300, CTCV 2354 and SDSS 1152. All three systems are below the observed "period gap" for cataclysmic variables. For each system we determine the system parameters by fitting a parameterised model to the observed eclipse light curve by chi-squared minimisation. We also present an updated analysis of all other eclipsing systems previously analysed by our group. New donor masses are generally between 1 and 2 sigma of those originally published, with the exception of SDSS 1502 and DV UMa. We note that the donor mass of SDSS 1501 has been revised upwards by 0.024Msun. This system was previously identified as having evolved passed the minimum orbital period for cataclysmic variables, but the new mass determination suggests otherwise. Our new analysis confirms that SDSS 1035 and SDSS 1433 have evolved past the period minimum for cataclysmic variables, corroborating our earlier studies. We find that the radii of donor stars are oversized when compared to theoretical models, by approximately 10 percent. We show that this can be explained by invoking either enhanced angular momentum loss, or by taking into account the effects of star spots. We are unable to favour one cause over the other, as we lack enough precise mass determinations for systems with orbital periods between 100 and 130 minutes, where evolutionary tracks begin to diverge significantly. We also find a strong tendency towards high white dwarf masses within our sample, and no evidence for any He-core white dwarfs. The dominance of high mass white dwarfs implies that erosion of the white dwarf during the nova outburst must be negligible, or that not all of the mass accreted is ejected during nova cycles, resulting in the white dwarf growing in mass.

MESA can now simultaneously evolve an interacting pair of differentially rotating stars undergoing transfer and loss of mass and angular momentum, greatly enhancing the prior ability to model binary evolution. New MESA capabilities in fully coupled calculation of nuclear networks with hundreds of isotopes now allow MESA to accurately simulate the advanced burning stages needed to construct supernova progenitor models. Implicit hydrodynamics with shocks can now be treated with MESA, enabling modeling of the entire massive star lifecycle, from pre-main-sequence evolution to the onset of core collapse and nucleosynthesis from the resulting explosion. Coupling of the GYRE non-adiabatic pulsation instrument with MESA allows for new explorations of the instability strips for massive stars while also accelerating the astrophysical use of asteroseismology data. We improve the treatment of mass accretion, giving more accurate and robust near-surface profiles. A new MESA capability to calculate weak reaction rates “on-the-fly” from input nuclear data allows better simulation of accretion induced collapse of massive white dwarfs and the fate of some massive stars. We discuss the ongoing challenge of chemical diffusion in the strongly coupled plasma regime, and exhibit improvements in MESA that now allow for the simulation of radiative levitation of heavy elements in hot stars. We close by noting that the MESA software infrastructure provides bit-for-bit consistency for all results across all the supported platforms, a profound enabling capability for accelerating MESA's development.}

This method accommodates a broad range of stellar types, from substellar objects to high-mass stars, and phases of evolution, from the pre-main sequence to the white dwarf cooling sequence. I discuss situations in which stellar physics leads to departures from the otherwise monotonic relation between initial stellar mass and lifetime, and how these may be dealt with in isochrone construction. I close with convergence tests and recommendations for the number of points in the uniform basis and the mass between tracks in the original grid required to achieve a certain level accuracy in the resulting isochrones.
